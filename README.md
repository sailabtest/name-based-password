Your company Safes-R-Us have asked you to implement a new digital safe. Like all top end safes it needs a password to access items. Based on the password you may get an item out of the safe.
Your task is to write a function that will generate the correct password based on the customers name who is trying to access the safe.
----
The password structure is as follows:
<section1>-<section2>-<section3>-<section4>-<section5>
__Section 1__
The first name length added to the last name length.
  i.e. `'David Lindley' = 5 + 7 = 12`
__Section 2__
  The captialised last letter of the first name
  i.e. `'David Lindley' = 'D'`
__Section 3__
  The lowercasefirst character of the last name
  i.e. `'David Lindley' = 'l'`
__Section 4__
  The total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the full name
  i.e. `'David Lindley' = 4`
__Section 5__
  A hash of the name based on the following:
  1. Any duplicate characters removed
  i.e. `'David Lindley' = 'Davi Lney'`
  2. Remove any blank spaces from step 1
  i.e. `'Davi Lney' = 'DaviLney'`
  3. Replace every character from step 2 with its lowercase UTF-8/16 character code
  i.e. `'DaviLney' = [100, 97, 118, 105, 108, 110, 101, 121]`
  4. The output from step 3 added together:
  i.e. `100 + 97 + 118 + 105 + 108 + 110 + 101 + 121 = 860`
  The output from step 4 is the code for Section 5
__Example password__
  `'David Lindley' = '12-D-l-4-860'`
  ------
__Handling edge cases__
  If for any reason a full name cannot satifisy the conditions to create the output, then the entire section should be skipped. Multiple `-` should not appear in the password.  
  -----
__Using the password__
  Once you have generated a password, to get the items from the safe you should use the predefined function:
  `getItemFromSafe(password)` 
 This function returns a promise (as opening the safe could take time), it will resolve with the item or rejcect with a error message. 
  The item or the error message should then be returned from your function in order to check the safe is working correctly.

__Testing your work__
We have included a suite of Jest tests to assist you  in verifying your work. Feel free to add to these if it adds value.

To run these tests, first install the dependencies with 

`yarn install`

Then trigger the suite with:

`yarn test`
